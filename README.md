# COVID-19_Global_Forecasting

**Overview**
This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends and predicts future case numbers using Facebook Prophet, a time series forecasting model. By leveraging historical data, the project provides insights into the global spread of COVID-19 and predicts its trajectory over the next 30 days.

**Key Features**
_COVID-19 Data Analysis:_ Cleaning and processing global confirmed cases and deaths data.
_Data Visualizations:_ Interactive choropleth maps and line charts to visualize the trends.
Forecasting: Time series forecasting using Facebook Prophet to predict future COVID-19 cases.
Model Evaluation: Performance analysis using R² score to assess forecasting accuracy.
**Technologies Used**
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, NumPy)
Facebook Prophet for time series forecasting
Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and visualization
**Steps Involved**
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
Aggregated global COVID-19 data (confirmed cases and deaths) from multiple sources.
Cleaned and normalized country names to ensure consistency.
Handled missing values and prepared the data for modeling.
2. Data Visualization
Created a Choropleth Map using Plotly to visualize global COVID-19 cases by country.
Generated line charts showing daily confirmed cases and deaths over time, with rolling averages to capture trends.
3. Time Series Forecasting with Prophet
Used Facebook Prophet to build a forecasting model for the next 30 days of global COVID-19 cases.
Generated predictions with confidence intervals, allowing for insight into potential future case numbers.
Evaluated the model’s forecasting ability using the R² score.
Forecasting Results
30-day Forecast: Provides a prediction for global COVID-19 cases, offering insights into potential future trends.
Confidence Intervals: Visualized the uncertainty in predictions with upper and lower bounds.
